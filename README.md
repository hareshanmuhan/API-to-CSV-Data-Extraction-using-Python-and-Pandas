# API-to-CSV-Data-Extraction-using-Python-and-Pandas
 You can extract data from an API and convert it to CSV using Python and Pandas. First, use the requests library to fetch data from the API. Then, parse the JSON response and create a Pandas DataFrame. Finally, use the to_csv method to save the DataFrame as a CSV file, making it easy to work with structured data in Python.
